// 🔹 What is Automated Marketing in eCommerce?

// Automated marketing in eCommerce refers to the use of software and tools to automatically execute repetitive marketing tasks (like sending emails, showing ads, giving discounts, or personalizing product recommendations) based on customer behavior without manual effort.

// It’s all about engaging customers at the right time with the right message to increase sales, improve customer retention, and save time.

// 🔹 Key Automated Marketing Features in eCommerce
// 1. Email & SMS Automation

// Welcome emails when a customer signs up.

// Abandoned cart reminders to recover lost sales.

// Post-purchase follow-up emails (thank you, product care tips, reviews).

// Personalized offers & discounts on birthdays/anniversaries.

// 👉 Example: If a customer leaves items in their cart, an automated email/SMS goes out after 2 hours reminding them.

// 2. Product Recommendations

// Personalized product suggestions based on browsing/purchase history.

// “Customers also bought” or “Recommended for you” sections powered by AI.

// 👉 Example: Amazon suggests accessories when you buy a laptop.

// 3. Customer Segmentation & Targeting

// Automatically group customers (new vs. loyal vs. inactive).

// Target each group with tailored campaigns.

// 👉 Example: Loyal customers get exclusive early access to new products.

// 4. Loyalty & Rewards Automation

// Auto-apply loyalty points or discounts.

// Send reward reminders via email/SMS.

// 👉 Example: Shopify stores often use apps that automatically apply reward points at checkout.

// 5. Dynamic Pricing & Discounting

// Automated discount codes for first-time buyers.

// Price-drop alerts when a customer’s wishlist product goes on sale.

// 👉 Example: “The sneakers you liked are now 20% off!”

// 6. Social Media & Retargeting Ads

// Automated ad campaigns across Facebook, Instagram, Google.

// Retargeting visitors who viewed products but didn’t buy.

// 👉 Example: You browse a phone case on an eCommerce site → later, you see an ad for it on Instagram.

// 7. Chatbots & Conversational Marketing

// Automated 24/7 chat support for FAQs.

// Personalized product recommendations through chat.

// 👉 Example: “Looking for running shoes? Here are our bestsellers in your size.”

// 8. Customer Feedback & Review Requests

// Automated requests for reviews after purchase.

// Survey emails to gather insights.

// 👉 Example: “How did you like your order? Leave us a review and get 10% off next time.”
